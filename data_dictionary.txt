To identify the patterns for every consumer that may lead to money laundering 
like transferring money to foreign banks, big deposits, transaction patterns etc,
we can use machine learning approach to prevent money laundering at a certain extent.

For this we are using a synthetic dataset generated using the simulator called PaySim
as an approach to such a problem. PaySim uses aggregated data from the private dataset
to generate a synthetic dataset that resembles the normal operation of transactions
and injects malicious behaviour to later evaluate the performance of fraud detection methods.

PaySim simulates mobile money transactions based on a sample of real transactions extracted 
from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. 


This is a sample of 1 row with headers explanation:

1,PAYMENT,1060.31,C429214117,1089.0,28.69,M1591654462,0.0,0.0,0,0

step - maps a unit of time in the real world. In this case 1 step is 1 hour of time. 
Total steps 744 (30 days simulation).

type - CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT and TRANSFER.

amount - amount of the transaction in local currency.

nameOrig - customer who started the transaction

oldbalanceOrg - initial balance before the transaction

newbalanceOrig - new balance after the transaction

nameDest - customer who is the recipient of the transaction

oldbalanceDest - initial balance recipient before the transaction. 
Note that there is not information for customers that start with M (Merchants).

newbalanceDest - new balance recipient after the transaction. 
Note that there is not information for customers that start with M (Merchants).

isFraud - This is the transactions made by the fraudulent agents inside the simulation. 
In this specific dataset the fraudulent behavior of the agents aims to profit by taking control 
or customers accounts and try to empty the funds by transferring to another account 
and then cashing out of the system.

isFlaggedFraud - The business model aims to control massive transfers from one account to another 
and flags illegal attempts.
An illegal attempt in this dataset is an attempt to transfer more than 200.000 in a single transaction.
