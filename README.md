## 💡 Problem Statement :

To identify the patterns for every consumer that may lead to money laundering 
like transferring money to foreign banks, big deposits, transaction patterns etc, using machine learning.

## 📝 Proposed Solution :

In order to solve the problem we create a Machine Learning model which is able to take the data  and further classify them as Fraud or Not Fraud .

This solution can able to find:

-  Reduction of false positives in the AML Process
- Detecting the change in customer behavior
- Analysis of unstructured data and external data

## Goal :

The goal is to develop a method that minimizes false negatives when evaluating new data points.
## ⏳ Data Description :

Dataset from kaggle: [PaySim](https://www.kaggle.com/ealaxi/paysim1)

For this we are using a synthetic dataset generated using the simulator called PaySim.

PaySim simulates mobile money transactions based on a sample of real transactions extracted 
from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. This dataset contains `6362620` Transaction records with `11` features.

- 'PyCharm' is used as an IDE.
- For EDA , 'Pandas' and 'Numpy' are used.
- For  visualization , 'Matplotlib' and 'Seaborn' are used.
- 'Heroku Cloud Platform' is used for deployment of the model.
- Front end development is done using 'HTML/CSS'
- 'Flask' framework is used for backend development
- 'GitHub' is used as a version control system.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Web App

(https://moneylaundering.herokuapp.com/)

Our Web App Link:

In this web app, you just need to enter the path of your data. The model will start prediction and it will upload the outputs to the google drive folder.

In the result box, you can see the google drive folder link and output filename.
